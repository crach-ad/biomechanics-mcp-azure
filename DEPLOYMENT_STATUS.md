## ðŸ”„ Current Status

Both container apps are running with placeholder images (hello world pages). The ACR build process hit permission limitations, but the infrastructure is solid.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps: Deploy Actual Code

Since ACR Tasks has permission restrictions, here are three options to deploy our biomechanics code:

### Option 1: Manual Container Update (Recommended)
Use pre-built public images or build locally and push to a public registry.

### Option 2: GitHub Actions Deployment
Set up automated deployment from our GitHub repository.

### Option 3: Local Docker Build + Push
Build images locally and push to Azure Container Registry manually.

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for VS Code Integration

Even with placeholder containers, we can:
1. **Connect VS Code Agent Builder** to the MCP endpoint
2. **Test the infrastructure** and networking
3. **Update containers** with real code later

The MCP server endpoint is ready: `https://app-mcp-bio.livelyforest-5153f98b.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/mcp`
